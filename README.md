### :sunny: Cheer App!

Let's build a react giphy app!

#### Your task is:
* Go the Giphy API sign up page [here](https://developers.giphy.com/) and create an account.
* Click the Create An App button in the header. They will ask you for a name and a description for your app. After inputting that, you will get an API key - save that for later
* Go the API Explorer page [here](https://developers.giphy.com/explorer/) this shows you some sample URLs that correspond to the data that you want to get. For our purposes, go to the Choose An Endpoint dropdown and select Random
* The Request URL field should have been updated. Look for the part in the URL that says `api_key=`. Place your API key right after that. This is the URL that you will use to make the API call to in your React application.
* Create an app the starts out with a button and when the user clicks the button a random gif appears

#### 🚀 Completion looks like:

* The app should show a "loading..." message until the fetch call has been completed
* You have an application that renders a button on page load.
* When a user clicks the button, a random Gif appears on the screen.

#### HW Submission

* Commit messages should be made often!!
* Create a pull request 


#### BONUS Allow User To Search Gifs

* Add an input field that allows the user to add a search term
